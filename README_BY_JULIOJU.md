## Liquibase validation error after modify entity

- Check https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43207163/jhipster-liquibase-validation-error-after-modify-entity
- Correct the file generated by `./mvn liquibase:diff`. Especially remove irrelevant operations, like add an existing [PostgreSQL Sequence](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sequences/) or column.
- When you add a new column to an existing table, you should also checkout src/main/resources/config/liquibase/fake-data/entity.csv

## JHipster Upgrade

All code added by me into code generated by JHipster are between

```
START added by JulioJu
END added by JulioJu
```

To upgrade JHipster, I advise to perform manual upgrade
(see https://www.jhipster.tech/upgrading-an-application/#manual_upgrade)

Then, into your favorite GitHub diff tool, search all occurent of `JulioJu`
and check if added or removed code around this should be checkout or not.

## TODO
